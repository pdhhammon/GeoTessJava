<h2>GeoTess Java</h2>

<h3>User's Manual</h3>
The <a href="GeoTessUsersManual2020.pdf">User's Manual</a>
provides a high level overview of GeoTess.

<h3>GeoTess Library</h3>
GeoTess Java is mainly intended to be used as a
library in other java applications.  To use it in this capacity,
include a statement in your java code to <tt>import geotess.jar</tt>.
geotess.jar resides in the GeoTessJava directory (the same directory as this documentation file).  A complete description of the GeoTessJava interface can be found in the javadocs:

<p><a href="doc/index.html">GeoTess JavaDocs</a>

<p>The source code for the library is provided in the <tt>src</tt> directory and several example applications can be found in the <tt>src\main\java\gov\sandia\geotess\examples</tt> directory.  The examples illustrate how to
<ul>
<li><tt>TestCrust20</tt> - interrogate a model for interpolated model values
<li><tt>PopulateModel2D</tt> - populate a 2D model with data
<li><tt>PopulateModel3D</tt> - populate a 3D model with data
<li><tt>GeotessModelExtended</tt> - extend GeoTessModel.java to manage
user defined data that cannot be stored in the base class.
</ul>


<h3>GeoTessExplorer Application</h3>
GeoTess can be launched as an application called GeoTessExplorer
which can perform various utilities related to GeoTessModels
and GeoTessGrids.  To try this out immediately, go to the
GeoTessJava directory and type
<p><tt>java -Xmx1024m -jar geotess.jar</tt>
<p>GeoTessExplorer will print out a list of the functions it can
perform.  Append the name of any of the listed functions as a command
line argument and GeoTessExplorer will list the additional arguments
that must be supplied in order to perform the desired function.

<p>To configure GeoTessExplorer to be more conveniently accessible,
execute the bash script <tt>configure_geotess.sh</tt> which is located
 in the GeoTessJava directory.  This script generates
a two-line executable script called
<tt>geotess</tt> that will launch the GeoTessExplorer
application.  The configuration script also prints to
the screen a recommended addition to the user's PATH
environment variable that will make the executable
accessible from any directory. No modifications to the
user's environment are performed by the configuration
script.  After running <tt>configure_geotess.sh</tt> and making
the recommended addition to the user's <tt>.cshrc</tt> or <tt>.bash_profile</tt>
file, executing the command <tt>geotess</tt> from any directory will
launch GeoTessExplorer.

<h3>GeoTessModels</h3>
A number of GeoTessModel and GeoTessGrid objects are delivered with the GeoTessJava package.  They can be found in the GeoTessModels subdirectory.  The file GeoTessModels/crust20.geotess contains
a version of the Crust 2.0 model of Bassin, Laske and Masters (2000).  To extract information
about the model execute
<p><tt>java -Xmx1024m -jar geotess.jar toString GeoTessModels/crust20.geotess</tt>
<p>The GeoTessModels directory includes several GeoTessGrid files. Most have file names of the form <tt>geotess_grid_xxxxx.geotess</tt> where <tt>xxxxx</tt> reflects the edge lengths of the triangles in millidegrees.  The file <tt>small_model_grid.ascii</tt> contains a grid with 3 multi-level tessellations having geographic resolutions of 64, 32 and 16 degrees, respectively.
